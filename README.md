# ShowMatch

## What is it?

ShowMatch is an app that solves the problem of not being able to decide what to watch with your friends.

With ShowMatch you and your friends just open the app, scan the hosts code and set how many movies you want recommended. Then you just swipe left or right on movies you don't like and like. 

When you reach the end, the app displays how many users liked and disliked a certain movie and you can watch the movie with the most likes.

It's as simple as that.
